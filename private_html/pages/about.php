        <h1>About - Who I am and what I do</h1>
    </header>
    <p>My name is Oscar Freij, and I am a geeky tech nerd, who loves to tinker with computers, software, and hardware.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a IT Technician where I focus on workplace related tasks, such as setting up and maintaining computers, networks, and other IT infrastructure.
        <br>
        Another part of my job is to help users with their IT related issues, and to provide support and training on how to use the systems and software we have in place.
        <br>
        Aswell as to help with the development of new systems and software to improve our workflows and processes for either asstance or automation.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also have a passion for programming, and I enjoy creating software and tools that can help me and others in their daily work.
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned above, I have a few projects that I have worked on, and you can find more information about them on the <a href="/?page=projects">projects page</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, coding random projects, watching movies and TV shows, and spending time with my friends and family.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also (used) enjoy streaming on Twitch, where I play games and chat with my viewers. You can find me on Twitch at <a href="https://twitch.tv/offthegridcg">OffTheGridCG</a>.
        <br>
        I also have a YouTube channel where I upload videos of my streams and other content.
        You can find it at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@offthegridgc9654">OffTheGridCG</a>.
        <br>
        However, I have not been active on Twitch or YouTube for a while now, and I am currently focusing on other projects and interests.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, I am a tech enthusiast who loves to tinker with computers and software, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.
